Project Description: Household Chore tracker for parents to assign and manage chores to their children. Children can view and set their chores to finished. Parents can then review the work and mark them as complete and remove from the instance as desired. This will eventually have a fully tied in reward/point system. 
Backlog:
    - Additional parent can join household post household creation
    - Parents can create a child account from their own account 
    - History of completed jobs
    - Point/Reward system
        - Each chore has a point value associated 
        - Child completing the chore will credit their account with the associated points
            - Parent completing a chore that is assigned to a child will deduct the points from the child's account
        - Eventual redemption method:
            - Child can turn in points for specific rewards, set by parents
            - Redemption takes away the points from child's account
            - Need to figure out where the redemption will show in the parent account
    - Dark mode? 
    - Recurring chores
        - Create chores with recurring timelines, daily, weekly, monthly
    - "Social" feed of created/edited/completed chores
    - Alerts for parents when chores are marked as finish by children
    - Delete children
    - password resets
