Project Name: Household Chore Tracker
Project Description: I like the chore tracker wireframe from the platform, but where that reads as a site for people to pick up odd jobs, I want to turn this into 
a Household Chore Tracker for parents to create chores for their children to track and complete. Parents can create their household and have an 'admin' type account. Children can have 
subsidiary accounts that are tied to the household/parent with limited functionality.
MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features: 
    - Login/Reg - 
        - Mostly standard login/Reg
        - Account type: Parent or Child
        - If selecting child account during reg - conditional render for additional field to select household (i.e. child account can't create without being tied to household)
    - Households - 
        - Household can only be created by parent account
        - Only parent can edit household 
        - Children can only join household when registering (and can't register without doing so)
        - Logged in parent will automatically be assigned as "head of household" or something similar
        - Only show info for logged in househould (instance)
    - Chores - 
        - Parents can create/edit/delete chores and complete chores
        - Children can only view and mark chores as complete
        - Completed chores to have a "completed by:" field and timestamp
        - Only show chores for logged in household (instance)
        - Chore status - Open, in progress, complete
        - Completed chores will remain in dashboard until parents remove
Bonus Features:
    - Additional parent can join household post household creation
    - Parents can create a child account from their own account 
    - Parents can assign the chore to a child or leave it as open to all
    - History of completed jobs
    - Point/Reward system
        - Each chore has a point value associated 
        - Child completing the chore will credit their account with the associated points
            - Parent completing a chore that is assigned to a child will deduct the points from the child's account
        - Eventual redemption method:
            - Child can turn in points for specific rewards, set by parents
            - Redemption takes away the points from child's account
            - Need to figure out where the redemption will show in the parent account
    - Parents can mark a chore as complete by a child? 
    - Dark mode? 
    - Recurring chores
        - Create chores with recurring timelines, daily, weekly, monthly
    - Chore due dates - Done
    - "Social" feed of created/edited/completed chores
    - Alerts for parents when chores are completed - obsolete due to changing of how chores completed - maybe a needs review alert
